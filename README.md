## A Home For My Coding Projects

The projects in this repository are my own work and these give you a snapshot of my competencies with various programming languages.

### Melbourne Water Evaporation Predictive Model

This is a fictitious Case Study utlising real world data to create a linear model predicting the amount of water evaporation at Cardinia Reservoir (Melbourne's main water supply) on any respective day. An initial set of qualifying variables were processed via a dimensional reduction algorithm to filter a subset of remaining variables which exhibited statistical significance. These remaining variables (the daily minimum temperature, month of the year, and relative humidity measured at 9am on the given day) were then used to create the model which included confidence intervals and prediction intervals at the 90% level. This project was created in **R programming language** and is available in R Markdown format and .pdf format. The Case Study was completed over a 3-week period as part of a Master's level Applied Data Science course with The University of Adelaide.

### Global Pandemic Analysis

This analysis uses real world data taken from the 'Our World In Data COVID -19 Dataset' which can be found at https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv .
The anaysis uses Python to produce visualisations of the current COVID-19 pandemic (attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus) and the relationship between different data with some interesting comparisons to Swine flu. The anaysis was completed over a 6-week period as part of a Master's level Applied Data Science course with The University of Adelaide.
