### Melbourne Water Evaporation Predictive Model

This is a fictitious Case Study utlising real world data to create a linear model predicting the amount of water evaporation at Cardinia Reservoir (Melbourne's main water supply) on any respective day. An initial set of qualifying variables were processed via a dimensional reduction algorithm to filter a subset of remaining variables which exhibited statistical significance. These remaining variables (the daily minimum temperature, month of the year, and relative humidity measured at 9am on the given day) were then used to create the model which included confidence intervals and prediction intervals at the 90% level. This project was created in R programming language and is available in R Markdown format and .pdf format. The Case Study was completed over a 3-week period as part of a Master's level Applied Data Science course with The University of Adelaide.
