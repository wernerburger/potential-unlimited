A home for my coding projects 
The projects in this repository are my own work and these give you a snapshot of my competencies with various programming languages. 
The project entitled 'Melbourne Water Evaporation Predictive Model' is a fictitious Case Study utlising real world data to create a linear model predicting the amount of water evaporation at Cardinia Reservoir (Melbourne's main water supply) on any respective day given weather conditions categorised by the daily minimum temperature, month of the year, and relative humidity measured at 9am on a given day. The model is used to create confidence intervals and prediction intervals with 90% confidence. This project was created in R programming language and completed within a 5 week period as part of a Master's level Applied Data Science course with The University of Adelaide.
